# [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io) settings

ps.: i'm using
[AndCake's LSP plugin](https://github.com/AndCake/micro-plugin-lsp) mainly for
development with Javascript and HTML. As it is only the LSP client, you can use
any LSP server but what worked for me was
[this for typescript](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server)
and [this for HTML](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted).

to use this settings and plugins, just paste the files and folders at
`~/.config/micro`.
